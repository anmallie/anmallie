## Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to my repository! It's pretty empty right now, but I plan to change that!

### About Me

I am a student at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/)
as a major in **Computer Science & Engineering**.

I love coding in **Python** and **C**, but I am also familiar with **C++**, **C#**, and **Java**.
